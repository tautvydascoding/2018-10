      HTML for structuring contentSection
The simple example shown above isn't pretty, but it is perfectly ok for illustrating a typical website layout example. Some websites have more columns, some are way more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted, but as discussed before, we need to respect semantics, and use the right element for the right job.

This is because visuals don't tell the whole story. We use color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts of the content, like the navigation menu and related links, but what about visually impaired people for example, who might not find concepts like "pink" and "large font" very useful?

Note: Colorblind people represent around 8% of the world population or, to put it another way, approximately 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 200 women are colorblind. Blind and visually impaired people represent roughly 4-5% of the world population (in 2012 there were 285 million such people in the world, while the total population was around 7 billion).

In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their functionality — you can use elements that represent the sections of content described above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screenreaders can recognise those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." As we mentioned earlier in the course, there are a number of consequences of not using the right element structure and semantics for the right job.

To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:


    </article>

<div class="side middle">
