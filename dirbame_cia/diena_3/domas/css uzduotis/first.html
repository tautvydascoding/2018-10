          <h2>HTML for structuring contentSection</h2>
    The simple example shown above isn't pretty, but it is perfectly ok for illustrating a typical website layout example. Some websites have more columns, some are way more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted, but as discussed before, we need to respect semantics, and use the right element for the right job.

    This is because visuals don't tell the whole story. We use color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts of the content, like the navigation menu and related links, but what about visually impaired people for <h4>example, who might not find</h4> concepts like "pink" and "large font" very useful?

    Note: Colorblind people represent around 8% of the world population or, to put it another way, approximately 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 200 women are colorblind. Blind and visually impaired people represent roughly 4-5% of the world population (in 2012 there were 285 million such people in the world, while the total population was around 7 billion).
