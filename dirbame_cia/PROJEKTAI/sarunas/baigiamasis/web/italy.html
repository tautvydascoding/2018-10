    <h1>
        Italy baby!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Italy, which is located along the Mediterranean Sea in Southern Europe, became a nation-state in 1861 when the
        regional
        states of the peninsula (along with Sardinia and Sicily, the two largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea) were
        united
        under the Kingdom of Italy. After the Second World War, in 1946, a popular referendum abolished the monarchy
        and
        proclaimed Italy a parliamentary republic.

        Italy is composed of 20 administrative regions, with Rome as the capital. It has a population of about 60
        million, and
        its territory covers about 301,000 square kilometres. The official language of Italy is Italian, and the
        currency is
        the euro (EUR).

        Italy has a diversified economy, which is divided into a developed industrial north, featuring many private
        companies,
        and a less-developed south. The economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer
        goods
        produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of which are family owned. Due to its archaeological and
        artistic
        heritage, tourism is one of the most important sectors.

        Italy is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization
        (NATO). It
        is also a member state of the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and Organisation for
        Economic
        Co-operation and Development (OECD).

        PwC Italy supports clients with the local knowledge and skills of its people and with access to a broad range
        of other
        professionals across the PwC global network of firms.

        In particular, PwC Tax & Legal has 15 offices in Italy with more than 700 professionals and is active in local
        and
        international markets providing tax and legal services. The covered areas are: corporate income tax, indirect
        tax,
        international tax, legal, mergers and acquisitions, tax accounting, tax controversy and dispute resolution,
        transfer
        pricing, etc.
